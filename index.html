      <p><br>Our current unlikely heroes have found themselves caught and imprisoned on their very first session. 
        It take not take them very long to figure out a way to escape the prison and find the first pieces of gear. 
        Their curious nature had them stumble upon a torture room in which a wicked necromancer was doing experiments
        on unwilling subjects. Coming out of the battle as victors they discovered several other items and the first
        steps in to <a href="professions.html">professions</a>. The torture room became an unlikely place for a rest
        as it is also happingly avoided by the occupants of this place. The adventures continued their exploration
        of their surroundings and had a small skirimish with some bandits around a small encampment. Some tents may
        or may not have 'accidentally' caught on fire, but the enemies were disposed off quickly. Not resting on their
        laurels the players found a side cave with multiple <s>slaves</s> prisoners with jobs whom they set free. In
        this cave they found a strange device which seems to mind-control nearby entities. They turned off the device 
        which set free a bugbear. The bugbear only spoke broken common, but was released by the group after a short 
        conversation. This decision paid off quickly, when the group headed out again. At the entrance of what was now 
        revealed to be a cave several corpses lay around with bugbear wounds. Exploring outside several more corpses 
        where found, including the poor bugbear. Crawling outside at night made it possible to sneak around and the 
        group found another cave. Exploring this cave they got ambushed and captured by what later turned out
        to be a group of rebels hiding from the pillaging of Trepa. After a short respite, our heroic adventurers once
        again travelled in to the darkness. Scouting around a bridge was found. When they tried crossing it their cover
        was blown and a small fight broke out. A small amount of luck and because of the bugbear his earlier rampage they 
        werent discovered and managed to move on. Another cave was explored and it turned out to house somekind of temple.
        This is where the story paused.</p>
